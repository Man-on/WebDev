        <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
        <p>ELEVATE was founded with the belief that business attire should be both stylish and comfortable, empowering professionals to perform at their best.</p>

        <h3>Inspiration Behind ELEVATE</h3>
        <p>It all started when our founder, Christian Man-on, noticed a gap in the market—business attire was either too stiff and uncomfortable or too casual for a professional setting. 
           While working long hours in a corporate job, Christian realized that confidence starts with how you dress. 
           With a vision to redefine business fashion, ELEVATE was born—offering premium-quality clothing that blend elegance, comfort, and professionalism.</p>

        <p>“A sharp mind deserves a sharp look. When you feel good in what you wear, success follows.” — Christian Man-on, Founder of ELEVATE.</p>
